# Minimal BrightSign HTML video player

This repo provides a simple configuration for HTML video playback at high quality on a BrightSign. The device used to test was a BrightSign LS423.

## Getting Started

Download the repo to your local machine. You will also need access to a video file for testing playback- you might like to use [Big Buck Bunny](http://bbb3d.renderfarming.net/download.html).

Load the video file, the `index.html` and the `autorun.brs` onto the SD card of the BrightSign. You will need to either change the name of the video file to `video.mp4`, or the place in `index.html` that references the video as `video.mp4`. Reboot the BrightSign to see your changes take effect.
